The "Java Advanced" course covers working with the Java language. In this course we learned to create linear data structures, to solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), work with streams, files and directories, create template classes. Attention was paid to the paradigm of functional programming, as well as to the main tool relying on it - Stream API for processing data streams. The development environment that is used by us is IntelliJ Idea 2020.

The actual themes in this course:
## --- 1. Stacks and Queues
## --- 2. Multidimensional Arrays
## --- 3. Sets and Maps Advanced
